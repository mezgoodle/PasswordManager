 ðŸŒŸHello everyone! This is the bot that stores your passwords in the database.ðŸŒŸ
</p>

## Motivation :exclamation:

Recently, I created a [template](https://github.com/mezgoodle/bot_template/tree/aiogramv3) for developing bots on the third version of aiogram and wanted to try it out as soon as possible. I also heard a lot about [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and thought why not use it in the project? So, I made a bot that shows your passwords (and password folders) that are encrypted in the database. Registration and login are also implemented using Supabase services.
